In this report, I'm going to be discussing:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Details about my employer, [Insignia Software Inc.](https://www.insigniasoftware.com)
2. The **goals** I set for myself at the start of the work term and how I achieved them
3. Brief summary of my **day-to-day responsibilities** and what I've learned along the way
4. Some of the lessons I learned and my **main takeways** from this work term
5. **Acknowledging** some of the awesome people that have helped me succeed in this work term

</Steps>

In reading this, I hope you gain a comprehensive understanding of what my work term was like and what skills, knowledge (technical and non-technical), and lessons I've acquired.
