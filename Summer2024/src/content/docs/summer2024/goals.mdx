### General Reflection
When I sat down to choose my learning goals I made sure to choose goals I thought were realistically achievable, challenging, and beneficial in the long term.

As I discuss below, I believe the goals I chose are very closely aligned with my job tasks while also being generally applicable to other software development roles I will be in in the future.

In this work term I learned a lot about numerous technologies I had never used or even heard of before. Many of them I used, others I learned about as it was still pertinent to performing my job properly. The technologies are as follows:
<Steps>
1. **.NET** (C#, EntityFramework, Visual Studio, WPF)
2. Web (Bootstrap, Blazor Server, Blazor WASM)
2. **InnoSetup** - used to make .msi software installers
3. **DevExpress** - used to create, modify, and print office documents
</Steps>

### Goals I set at the beginning of the work term

<Steps>
1. **Integrative Communication**: I would like to improve my interpersonal skills, especially in a professional business environment. I want to learn more about workplace culture and how that affects communication.
2. **Technological Literacy**: I want to cultivate my programming skills by learning new technologies (.NET, etc), learn about different facets of software development (design patterns, deployment, etc), and gain a better understanding of the typical business requirements to code pipeline.
3. **Personal Organization / Time Management**:
I want to figure out the best and most efficient way to learn a new concept. This may be a programming language, a framework, or a tools. By doing this I will be able to better extract value from my time.
</Steps>


### My attempt achieving those goals and what I learned
<Aside>Much of this reflection has been pulled directly from my 'Learning Goals' document on Experience Guelph</Aside>

<Steps>
1. **Integrative Communication**: My plan to achieve this goal was to be assertive and remain humble when communicating with people at work, learning norms along the way. By following this action plan I was able to learn about effective corporate communication and workplace norms. I believe I am now very well equipped to participate in these kinds of discussions.
2. **Technological Literacy**: I was able to achieve this goal by focusing my learning on foreign unused technologies. In doing so I was able to gain a lot of knowledge about general software engineering practices, specific technologies (.NET, C#, etc), and the business requirements to hands-on development to production release pipelines.
3. **Personal Organization / Time Management**: My plan was to find the most efficient way to learn something. I chose this because I realized I was figuratively 'throw into the deep end' in terms of using new technologies. My boss was very helpful where he could be, but ultimately being a proactive learner is up to each individual. As such, I found myself learning a bunch of new technologies all of the time.

    While I haven't been able to fully achieve this goal (I think it takes a while to do so), I believe I've been able to create a simple framework to help facilitate learning something new. **The steps are as follows**:
    <Steps>
    0. If you have access to someone who is knowledgeable about the subject, ask them general questions about the topic and try to gain as much preliminary knowledge as possible
    1. If there is specific source material, refer to it and consume it in its entirety
    2. Search multiple sources on the internet (google, youtube, wiki, etc) to get a broad and general understanding of the topic and how other people interact/use it
    3. If applicable, try to use it practically and build something. If you run into an issue repeat any of these steps
    </Steps>
